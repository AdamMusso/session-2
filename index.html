        <h3>Le groupe</h3>
        <strong>The Beatles</strong> were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the history of popular music. Their best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, they later utilised several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as "Beatlemania", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.

        <h2>Les paroles</h2>
        <p>
          Words are flowing out like<br />
          Endless rain into a paper cup<br />
          They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.<br />
          Pools of sorrow waves of joy<br />
          Are drifting through my opened mind<br />
          Possessing and caressing me.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Jai Guru Deva. Om<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Images of broken light, which<br />
          Dance before me like a million eyes,<br />
          They call me on and on across the universe.<br />
          Thoughts meander like a<br />
          Restless wind inside a letter box<br />
          They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Jai Guru Deva. Om<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Sounds of laughter, shades of life<br />
          Are ringing through my opened ears<br />
          Inciting and inviting me.<br />
          Limitless undying love, which<br />
          Shines around me like a million suns,<br />
          It calls me on and on across the universe<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Jai Guru Deva, om.<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
          Nothing's gonna change my world<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Jai Guru Deva<br />
          Jai Guru Deva<br />
          Jai Guru Deva<br />
          Jai Guru Deva<br />
          Jai Guru Deva<br />
